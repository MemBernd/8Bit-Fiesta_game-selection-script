# 8Bit-Fiesta_game-selection-script
8-Bit Fiesta script for Windows to automatically select the games you want to play

Simple script which selects the games you want through a sequence of down arrows and enter.
It is activated by
- Win + x
- Win + y
- Win + z
- Shift + Esc

while 8BitFiesta is focused. The pointer hast to be on 'Play', otherwise it won't work correctly.

The .exe file is an already compiled version of the script, though I recommend to compile it by yourself. If you want to change the games to your preference you have to change the values in the array and compile it again.
if the value is '1', 'enter' isn't pressed. Everything else makes it press enter which toggles the state.
